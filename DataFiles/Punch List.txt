**Please put all additions to the prog punch list in this immediate sub-section! I will categorize them.
USB Routing blocks inter-room routes in NodeMST, move to GlobalMST instead
This will allow zero src routing using existing plumbing
Then route zero src from room on shutdown
However this will block any chance of inter-room routing in the future, which sounds like will not be an issue
* --> Or remove all room USB logic and move in Global from fProcessUSB to an fProcessMTRX condition, same inter-room block issue
* --> Or move all USB data strictly to the macros list <-- cleanest way
Move system_presets to macros

Change all DGE device extenders from Touch Activity to Panel Activity
Revise black screen timeout accordingly
CP3s will intermittently fail to reset the Eth blocker flag
Cameras lag when processor reboots
Make these room features dynamic:
Main Cisco VTC
Admin Cisco VTC
Privacy Mute
CMic Mute
Admin Lights
Admin Global
Main Cameras
Fix camera-to-Mediaport auto-route when selecting camera from Main Cameras
RC Mutes should block default
BioComm - Fix audio routing
Fix the admin VSRC list. Again.
Classrooms - on !RC hide 'other' rooms cameras from admin VSRC list
Revise data pipeline for Macros lists
Create 1 list instead
Fixed macro_id functions
add room_ass=nn
add macro_id=nn   (use_guid_indexing=0)
Temporary Requests from Bethke
buttons on simdeck panel to turn video wall on/off and set displays to tile mode on/off. globally is fine, i.e. all displays go to tile mode.
buttons on simdeck panel to turn simdeck projectors on/off
Should be a button on splash page to show PC without starting system
Macro-3 function
Load all panels
Update data lists
Add CMic Mute to bottom right of all classrooms
Add Priv mute to top right all pages
Initialize Partition state and preset after data lists load in
Add PGM audio and USB icons to the appropriate macro columns
Add FB functionality to the icons
Add DSP grouping in data lists for CMic, Priv Mute
RoomName is not ','
Add in join30 gauge on startup page
Fix double-press "Last Page" inv button on Fullscreen Vid
Add software solution to hardware problem - Planar EDID DGE timeout thingy 
Initialize cam1 select on boot / room startup
 
DSP
Test 2-destination DSP commands
e.g. Forum & rooms 442-445 to DSP02
Else to DSP01
 
Test reconfigured PGM routing implementation
Each room now has (2) PGM routers - 1st for local sources and RC, 2nd for global remote source. These are separate as a means to disallow any audio pathway loops through the global system
'Off' router source (just an empty input) should be the same value in each of the 2 routers
C# receives 0-nn input values. 
'0' asserts both routers to the "none" input
1-4 asserts 1-4 on the 1st router, asserts "none" input on 2nd router
5-8 asserts 1-4 on the 2nd router, asserts "none" input on 1st router
Volume faders and mutes
All faders and mutes should be working
Need to add vis to the level control, as some control points do not have both level and mute (e.g. privacy mute
6/7/2019This is all still on the list. Got about 60% of the way through both the router testing and the 2-destination testing
We need to add an API call to the dLive mixing console to "Mute the PA" The console is being decoupled form QSC due to latency issues, so when we are in Crestron control mode, we want to auto mute, or provide a button, to mute all the outputs from the Mix Rack.
Bug List
Room 306 - East projector (Left) does not turn on from control system
Static Variance
Forum
2x4 led displays - PowerOn/Off macro control
Check if we need to mute anything on System PowerOff macro
Check that all control points are defaulting on System PowerOff macro
Alt Room UIs

2x6 + Projector
531/532, 640/642
10x10 mtrx, x2 RoomCombine
TeleVis
4x displays
Televiz – 95% use case will be a single source selection routed to all projectors. At times, they may need the ability to custom route different sources to projectors. Since they have 2 HDMI wall plates in here, there is the opportunity for small working groups to get together and take over a projector using the wall plate input. I defer to you on how to manage this basic and advanced mode. It should NOT be hidden behind an admin page as the instructor will need access.
We haven’t discussed audio much for simdeck CR, but there are overhead speakers. They should be able to hear the televiz mixes, program audio from computers and simdeck mixes.
SimDeck
4-in V_Processor
Simdeck – Allow for direct routing of televiz sources and cameras to the simdeck video wall.

Boot Sequence
Implemented new VSRC and VDST data formats with sub-categorized data
This seems to have sped things up by ~20%
This revealed the other major slog, which is Data_Initializer.
Why did this module work fast at Cedars but not here?
FileOps is closed immediately after reading in file, so that is not likely the issue
Revising lists again - removing keys from kv pairs, and ordering all columns like a .csv
Discussed with Ira creating an excel macro that would contain kv pairs on one tab, and then automatically creates value tables on 2nd tab
The above ideas have been retired, outdated, dismissed, excused.
Sam shared a document from Masters 2019 that is very applicable to many of the processor related issues I'm seeing. Will review with Ira and Sam to brainstorm on potential improvements to utilization
Processor Issues
Every 15 seconds, the system lags for 1-2 seconds
This happens while the system is otherwise idling, nothing automated in debugger, nothing in splustasks
Also occurs with 1/2 of the rooms loaded, which would be the equivalent if the processing was divided across 2x Pro3 units
System Monitor shows funky processor behavior
--Solved? Requires more testing, however this may have largely been due to having multiple clock drivers within modules in the SIMPLW program. Removed.
Investigate moving the network disconnect/reconnect patch for EISCs over to C#
Current patch in SIMPL Windows works, but requires cascading all 2000x strings across several different gates
6/7/2019 -- still a good idea, though not a priority
